# Roadmap
### v1
Firestarter v1 contains 2 services and an example application. With these
components you can track flights at the granularity of departures and arrivals
(using flight info messages) and view them in a FIDS-like interface.

### v2 (current release)
Firestarter v2 will introduce a robust queueing component between the connector
and its clients, allowing for efficient data fan-out.

### v3
Firestarter v3 adds support for processing and storage of airborne position data
from Firehose. It will likely also include a sample application for viewing such
data.

### v4
Firestarter v4 will support processing and storage of surface position data from
Firehose. It will likely also include a sample application for viewing such
data.
